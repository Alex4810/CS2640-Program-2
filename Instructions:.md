Instructions:

There are two tasks that you will need to complete to be eligible for full points on this assignment, just like Program 1. Use any additional instructions and registers as necessary. 

Task 1: Return a Letter Grade from User Input

Write an Assembly program that will return a letter grade given a Decimal int from the user. Include the following:

a user menu
a main label, a looping label, and an exit label
a way for the user to continue getting letter grades or choose to exit
invalid input handling (do NOT just print an error message and exit the program; re-prompt the user until a correct input is entered)
Task 1 Sample Output:

Program 1 Task 2 Sample Output

 

Notes for Task 1:

Grades typically fall on a range from 0 to 100. Scores above 100 are still considered valid in cases of extra credit, but scores below 0 are considered invalid since 0 is the lowest possible value of a grade. A strong program will take this into consideration when handling input errors
The following bullets show the numeric value of scores and their corresponding letter grade:
A: 100 - 90
B: 89 - 80
C: 79 - 70
D: 69 - 60
F: 59 - 0
 

Task 2: Advanced Math: x to the power of y

Write a program in Assembly that takes in two ints from a user. One int will be 'x' and the other will be 'y'. Make sure that user will know which value is 'x' and 'y'. Find the result of 'x' to the power of 'y'. Output the result to the user. Include the following in your program:

a main label, a looping label, and an exit label
a loop counter
Task 2 Sample Output:

Program 2 Task 3 output

 

Submission: You will have two (2) attempts to submit your .asm file(s) in Canvas. Two (2) .asm files are expected; one file per task. All members of your group must submit on Canvas. Include the names of all team members. 1 point will be docked for every member of your group that does not submit on Canvas. If you submit late, only you have the 2% late reduction. 

 

Total Points: 30

Task 1: 15 points

Task 2: 10 points

 5 points for correctness, comments, best practices, etc.
